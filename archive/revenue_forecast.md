# 3-Year Revenue Forecast

To keep this realistic, we’ve modeled these numbers on mid-market to large enterprise clients ($500M – $5B revenue).

- **SAP Revenue Share:** 15% (Standard for Build partners).
- **Churn Rate:** 5% (Low, as EVI becomes embedded in the CFO’s monthly reporting).

- **Tier 1 (Essentials):** $40,000 / year
- **Tier 2 (Optimizer):** $120,000 / year
- **Tier 3 (Strategist):** $300,000 / year

### Analysis of the Growth Phases

#### Year 1: Validation & Refinement

- **Focus:** Perfecting the **Agnostic Mapping Layer** with 5 anchor clients across Manufacturing and Retail.
- **Goal:** Reach a 90%+ accuracy rate in predicting "Supplier Lags" and "Dunning Friction."
- **Cash Flow:** Mostly Tier 1 and Service fees. Your revenue covers your initial engineering burn.

#### Year 2: The SAP Store Breakout

- **Focus:** Global distribution via the SAP Store.
- **Goal:** Move 30% of Year 1 clients to Tier 2 (eCLV) and land the first Tier 3 (Federated) contracts.
- **The Multiplier:** Your **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** drops significantly as SAP’s own Account Executives start recommending your "Clean Core" extension to their accounts.

#### Year 3: The Network Effect (Maturity)

- **Focus:** Maximizing Tier 3 (Global Strategist) adoption.
- **Goal:** 25% of the total base on the Federated Network.
- **The Moat:** By Year 3, your **Global Base Model** has learned from 100 different SAP implementations. A new competitor would need 3 years of data to catch up to your predictive accuracy.

### Strategic Risks to Monitor

1. **Sales Cycle:** SAP sales cycles can be 6–9 months. We must maintain a strong pipeline to avoid the "Revenue Gap" in Year 2.
2. **Implementation Bottleneck:** To hit Year 3 targets, we need to automate the "Semantic Mapping" process further to avoid needing a massive consulting army.
3. **Data Privacy:** Any high-profile data leak in the Federated space (even if not ours) could tighten CISO requirements globally.

### Your Next Step

The numbers look aggressive but achievable given the $200B+ SAP economy. To make this "investor-ready," we need to define the **Sales & Marketing strategy**.

**Would you like me to draft a "Go-To-Market (GTM) Plan" specifically for the SAP Store, detailing how we will use SAP's "Co-Sell" program to let their sales team sell Project Vitality for us?**
