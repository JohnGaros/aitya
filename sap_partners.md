# SAP Prtners in Greece

## Introduction

In the Greek market, the "Gatekeepers" to the 20 companies listed above are the **SAP Gold Partners** and the **Big 4**. Because these firms are already "trusted advisors" with access to the client’s BTP cockpit and `ACDOCA` structures, partnering with them is the fastest way to scale Project Vitality without building a 50-person sales team.

Here are the 5 most influential partners in Greece to target for your **EVI/eCLV** engine.

### 1. Real Consulting (SAP Platinum Partner)

**Why they matter:** They are arguably the dominant SAP-only powerhouse in Greece. They handle some of the largest S/4HANA migrations (e.g., Motor Oil, Sklavenitis).

- **The Synergy:** Real Consulting focuses on the technical migration. You provide the **Post-Migration Intelligence**. They can "bundle" Project Vitality as a value-add service to their existing maintenance contracts.

### 2. PwC Greece (The "C-Suite" Connector)

**Why they matter:** PwC leads the "Strategic Transformation" market in Greece. They aren't just installing software; they are advising the CFO on business restructuring.

- **The Synergy:** Your **eCLV** and **EVI** metrics are exactly what a PwC consultant needs to prove the ROI of a digital transformation. They provide the "Strategy," and you provide the "Engine" that monitors it.

### 3. TEKMON (The Innovative Niche Player)

**Why they matter:** While smaller than the Big 4, TEKMON is a highly specialized Greek firm that focuses on **SAP BTP and digital process automation**.

- **The Synergy:** They understand the "Clean Core" philosophy better than most. They are the perfect technical partner to help you refine your **Agnostic Mapping Layer** and ensure your BTP extension is "SAP Certified."

### 4. Deloitte Greece (The Innovation Center)

**Why they matter:** Deloitte has a major **Competence Center** in Thessaloniki that services not just Greece, but all of Europe.

- **The Synergy:** If you land a partnership with Deloitte Greece, you gain a portal to their global network. They are currently heavily invested in "AI for Finance," making your **Federated Learning** model a high-interest asset for their R&D lab.

### 5. IBM Greece (The Hybrid Cloud Specialist)

**Why they matter:** IBM is the primary partner for many "Old Guard" Greek industries (Utilities/Energy) that are moving to S/4HANA on a Hybrid Cloud architecture.

- **The Synergy:** IBM is a global leader in **Federated Learning** (via Watson). They will appreciate the mathematical sophistication of your gradient-sharing model and can help navigate the complex security audits required by Greek utilities.

### The "Partnership Pitch" Strategy

When approaching these five, do not sell them "software." Sell them a **"Consulting Accelerator."**

**Your Pitch to them:**

> _"You have the client’s trust and the S/4HANA implementation contract. We have a 'Clean Core' BTP extension that instantly visualizes the client’s **Enterprise Vitality** and **Customer Value**. Let’s install this as part of your 'Post-Go-Live' support to provide the CFO with immediate strategic ROI."_

### Co-petitors

In the SAP ecosystem, the Big 4 (Deloitte, PwC, EY, KPMG) operate as "Co-opetitors." They are your most dangerous competitors because they have the "keys to the kingdom" (client trust and data access), but they are also your most vital allies because they lack the **specialized, productized IP** that a lean startup can build.

#### The Competitor: Why They Are a Threat

The Big 4 have shifted from being just "integrators" to being **"Solution Builders."** \* **Internal Toolkits:** Firms like PwC and Deloitte have built their own "Accelerators" and "Industry Cloud" solutions on BTP. For example, Deloitte’s **Kinetic Enterprise™** and PwC’s **GenAI-powered toolkits** aim to solve the same "Clean Core" and "Value Extraction" problems you are targeting.

- **The "Service Drag":** Their business model is built on billable hours. If your engine automates an insight that a Big 4 team usually takes 3 months to calculate manually, you are technically "stealing" their billable hours.
- **White-Labeling Risks:** If you show them too much of your "Secret Sauce" without a strong IP moat, they have the resources to build a "good enough" version and bundle it into their existing multi-million dollar contracts.

#### The Partner: Why You Should Work With Them

Despite the competition, the Big 4 have a massive "Innovation Gap" that you can fill.

- **Product vs. Project:** The Big 4 are great at _projects_ (custom builds for one client), but they often struggle to build _products_ (scalable, agnostic software like yours). Your **Agnostic Mapping Layer** is a product they likely don't want to build and maintain themselves.
- **The "Trusted Advisor" Shortcut:** Greek giants like **PPC** or **Motor Oil** rarely buy software from unknown startups. They buy "Solutions" recommended by their Big 4 auditors. Partnering with a Big 4 firm gives you instant "Enterprise Grade" credibility.
- **Data Access:** Getting a CISO to agree to your **Federated Learning** model is 10x easier if PwC is the one vouching for your security architecture.

#### The "Big 4" Strategy: Protect & Partner

To work with them safely, you must change the power dynamic from "Vendor" to **"Force Multiplier."**

| **Do This**                                                                                                                                                                          | **Avoid This**                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Protect the "Inference Logic":** Your LaTeX formula and the weighting of the 5 EVI pillars must stay inside your compiled Docker container (the "Black Box").                      | **Don't share the "Weighting Code":** Never share the raw Python/Cython code that determines _how_ the EVI is calculated.                                                    |
| **Position as a "Lead-Gen" Tool:** Tell the Big 4: _"Our EVI dashboard will find 10 problems in your client's supply chain that you can then sell 5,000 consulting hours to fix."_   | **Don't compete on "Services":** If you try to do the implementation yourself, you become a direct threat to their revenue. Let _them_ do the service; you keep the license. |
| **Use SAP "Endorsed App" Status:** Get certified by SAP first. The Big 4 are much more likely to respect and partner with a startup that is already officially in the **SAP Store**. | **Don't go "Naked":** Avoid deep technical workshops before a **Mutual NDA** and a "Partnership Framework" are signed.                                                       |

#### Summary Recommendation for Greece

In Greece, the market is small and highly "relationship-driven."

- **The Recommendation:** **Partner early, but stay narrow.** \* Pick **one** Big 4 firm (e.g., Deloitte for their Thessaloniki Tech Hub) or a major integrator like **Real Consulting**. Offer them an **Exclusive Pilot** for the Greek market for 6 months.
- This gives them a "Competitive Edge" over the other firms, making them your champion rather than your competitor.
